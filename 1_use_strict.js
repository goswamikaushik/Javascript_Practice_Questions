"use strict";

// In JavaScript, "use strict"; is a directive that enables a stricter mode of interpretation by the browser or JavaScript engine. When you include "use strict"; at the beginning of a script or a function, it instructs the browser to execute the code in a strict operating context, enforcing more stringent rules and generating errors for common mistakes that would otherwise be ignored or would produce unpredictable behavior.
